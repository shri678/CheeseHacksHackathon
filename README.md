# NBAOracle

This is a submission for the CheeseHacks hackathon. 

This project uses NBA data from nba_api and gather data from all 30 teams in the NBA and 400+ players in the NBA.

We use the data from the regular season to make predictions on whether a team wins and specifies how strong the model predicts the outcome. 
Like a betting system, our algorithm also predicts whether a player will (over/under) reach a certain number regarding points, rebounds, or steals. 

The algorithm outputs the predicted number of points/rebounds/steals that the player will reach and also outputs the probability that the player will reach that goal.
